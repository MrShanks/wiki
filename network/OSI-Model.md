# OSI-Model

The OSI-Model is a standard that enables every device that complies with it to communicate with other devices using standard protocols
The idea is to define a standard made of multiple layer one stacked on top of the last

| Application Layer | Human-Computer interaction layer, where applications can access the network servicesa |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Presentation Layer | Ensure that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs |
| Session Layer | Maintains connections and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions |
| Transport Layer | Transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP |
| Network Layer | Decides which Physical path the data will take |
| Data Link Layer | Defines the format of data on the network |
| Physical Layer | Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium |
